			      <h3>Masters Dissertation - Development of a Virtual Reality Tanks game with Networking, Ray-Tracing and Procedural Generation.</h3>	

			      <p>The outcome of the project was to research and implement various aspects related to the title.
				 As such there a number of different parts created.

			     	<h3>Advanced Rendering - Genesis Animation </h3>

			     	<p>The aim of the assignment was to develop my HLSL through practical experience of programming graphics effects in HLSL 
				   targeting graphics hardware supporting shader model 5 profile. The outcome was to develop a app through writing a number of shaders in HLSL to create a virutal
				   world that animates genesis. Each graphics object had to be properly modelled, illuminated, and realistically animated for 
				   dynamic objects alongside all the objects needing to be carefully coordinated to provide a visually appealing graphics scene.

			     	<h3>C++ Programming and Design/Real Time graphics - Create a virutal gallery where models have various graphical effects applied onto them. </h3>	

			     	<p>The aim of the project was the implement a Virtual Gallery. In this it required a well designed and robust application such that the various rendering techniques would run smoothly. 
				   We had to also utilise Parasoft, which is a software which goes through code and informs you of bad practises.
				   Some of the rendering techniques are: 
					<br>1. Gouraud shading
				        <br>2. Phong shading
					<br>3. Bump mapping 
					<br>4. Displacement mapping 
					<br>5. Toon shading 
					<br>6. Transparency 
					<br>7. Environment mapping of the room 
					<br>8. Glowing using a post-processing technique
