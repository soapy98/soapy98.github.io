            graphics - Create a virutal gallery where
            models have various graphical effects applied onto them. </h3>
        <p>The aim of the project was the implement a Virtual Gallery. In this it required a
            well designed and robust application such that the various rendering techniques would run
            smoothly.
            We had to also utilise Parasoft, which is a software which goes through code and
            informs you of bad practises.
            Some of the rendering techniques are:
            <br>1. Gouraud shading
            <br>2. Phong shading
            <br>3. Bump mapping
            <br>4. Displacement mapping
            <br>5. Toon shading
            <br>6. Transparency
            <br>7. Environment mapping of the room
            <br>8. Glowing using a post-processing technique
