        <p>The aim of the assignment was to develop my HLSL through practical experience of programming
            graphics effects in HLSL targeting graphics hardware supporting shader model 5 profile. The
            outcome was to develop a app through writing a number of shaders in HLSL to create a virutal
            world that animates genesis. Each graphics object had to be properly modelled, illuminated,
            and realistically animated for dynamic objects alongside all the objects needing to be
            carefully coordinated to provide a visually appealing graphics scene.</p>
